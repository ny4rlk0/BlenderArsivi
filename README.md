3D Furniture Cafe Table Multicolor
September 21

Blender + fbx file created by me.
You can't upload as a asset to any store. (Unity Store, Unreal Engine Store, CSP store etc. You get the idea.) Because i am doing that. Other than that you can pretty much do anything with it. You can use it in commercial or private work, print in 3d and sell as accessory online without notifying me.
